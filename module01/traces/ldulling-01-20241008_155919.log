2024/10/08 13:59:24 [MOD01][EX01]: compilation error: stderr: error: current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not:
current:   /app/ldulling-01/ex01/Cargo.toml
workspace: /app/ldulling-01/Cargo.toml
this may be fixable by adding `ex01` to the `workspace.members` array of the manifest located at: /app/ldulling-01/Cargo.toml
Alternatively, to keep it out of the workspace, add the package to the `workspace.exclude` array, or add an empty `[workspace]` table to the package's manifest.
